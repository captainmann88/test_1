Reflection 2

Based on this week’s reading and the discussions following the reading assignment, there are two main concerns regarding open access publications 1) the cost to publish in open access platforms and 2) the lack of information revolving around open access. I think it is very interesting and also reassuring that funders such as NSF require grant recipients to make their data open access. As someone who has no experience with the publication process, I was surprised to find out how limiting and costly publications are. I naively thought that researchers are paid for their work- rather than having to pay to share their work with others. The entire scientific publication process seems incredibly limiting and biased towards wealthy individuals and institutions. For example: Karen Wilson of USM mentioned during our open discussion that the lack of funds from her institution repeatedly keeps her from publishing research. While there are some free open access journals available, the names of these journals do not appear to be common knowledge yet, considering how several members of our discussion group mentioned trying to publish in an open access journal, only to discover that they could not afford the cost. I wonder if more universities and educational institutions added such free open access journals to their databases that would help spread the word? I think it’s great (although daunting) that we are being coached on how to use open access and sharing platforms such as Git in this course. I look forward to learning more about publishing in a free open access journal!
